# AWS-based Trellis

Trellis is a Linked Data server designed for high performance. `trellis-ext-aws` is a subproject that implements
the core Trellis services to run directly in the Amazon cloud. This version of Trellis can be deployed as part
of an elastic beanstalk (each running Trellis-AWS in an EC2 container) or, simply, as a Lambda service.

**Note:** this is a work in progress.

## Requirements
