# AWS-based Trellis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/trellis-ldp/trellis-ext-aws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/trellis-ldp/trellis-ext-aws)

Trellis is a Linked Data server designed for high performance. `trellis-ext-aws` is a subproject that implements
the core Trellis services to run directly in the Amazon cloud. This version of Trellis can be deployed as part
of the ElasticBeanstalk service, as a Lambda service or running it directly across a fleet of EC2 containers.

**Note:** this is a work in progress.
